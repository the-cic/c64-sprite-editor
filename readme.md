# C64 Sprite editor

An attempt at making an in-browser editor of sprites following the limitations on size and colours of C64's VIC chip.

Multiple sprites can be edited together to create a more complex, multi-sprite image.

The finished sprites can be exported as a hex dump that can be used directly in a C64 emulator, or, if you like typing, on a real machine ;)
